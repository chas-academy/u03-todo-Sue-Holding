# Project structure

## Idea - 
My idea is based on a simple list of tasks that are saved in a databse and upon starting a log-in session the user can add tasks to their list and click once they are completed. It will also allow them to create their own tasks, delete tasks and make edits to existing.
It will be Harry potter themed and include some Christmas themed tasks.

## Plan - 
1. ER Diagram
2. Create simple Figma design
3. Create file structure in VS Code
4. Build database in MariaDB
5. Design a simple index.php using HTML and CSS
6. Build SQL questions with PDO
7. Create connection to index page with backend database
8. Fine tune styling
9. TEST
10. Feature expansion (if time allows)

## Execution - 
From week 48 - week 52 as outlined in assignment
1. Design and style index page
2. Create and connect database
3. Implement CRUD functions -
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete

## Production ready - 
Week 1 - 2. Application to be in a working function, with maybe some fine tuning to do.

## Retro Perspective - 
Week 2 -
Look back at the project: What went well? What went bad? How can I do it differently in my next project?
Feature expansion - any other desired features to implement?
